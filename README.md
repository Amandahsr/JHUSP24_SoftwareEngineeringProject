# JHUSP24_SoftwareEngineeringProject

Building a multiplayer digital game version of Cluedo, named "Clueless". 

To launch Clueless, run the following commands in your terminal after cloning the repository:
```python
# Launch server
python src/clueless/server.py

# Launch one client for each player
python src/clueless/main.py
```

Clueless operates on the same rules as the boardgame version Cluedo, but eliminates the need for dice rolls and allows each player to only take one action per turn. The objective of the game is simple: find the Character/Weapon/Room combination that answers the murder mystery!
